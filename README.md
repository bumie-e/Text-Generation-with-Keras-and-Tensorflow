# Text-Generation-with-Keras-and-Tensorflow
This is a deep learning application that generates text from chapters of a book

It was built using a SimpleRNN model using Keras and Tensorflow.

Since it's a Jupyter Notebook, the steps can also be reproduced by running the notebook.

Steps carried out are,
- Importing all necessary libaries
- Preprocessing methods like removing puncuations, stemming, tokeninzation, etc
- Building a Simple RNN model
- Training the model
- Generating the output
